# dog-and-cat-classifier
This project aims to build a deep learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs. We will utilize the powerful combination of Fastai, a high-level deep learning library, and PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.
This project serves as a practical introduction to deep learning for image classification using Fastai and PyTorch.
The resulting cat vs. dog classifier can be extended to other image classification problems.
